Project android-gsm-info

1. Global Description
The application android-gsm-info is a Mobile Application, running on Android devices
and providing the following functionalities:

- Detection of the GSM CellTower the Device is currently connected to.
  CellTowers detection is restricted to those of the provider of the SIMCard 
  installed in the device (e.g SwissCom, Sunrise, ...)

- Display of the current GSM CellTower information (CId, Lac, MNC, MCC, Signal Strength, GPS Location/Address).

- Display of the CellTowers currently stored in Database, as icons on a GoogleMap layer, 
  according to their GPS Location.
  
- GPS Location/Address information are retrieved through the call of a PHP Web Service 
  freely supplied by unwiredlabs.com (as long as you don't exceed 100 queries per day).

  
2. Detailed Description

	2.1 CellTower Information.
	A CellTower (AKA BTS) is an equipment that lets Smartphones connect to the GSM Network.

	As for our Application, it is defined by the following data:

		- CId	Unique number used to identify each Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 
				or sector of a BTS within a Location area code.
				
		- Lac	Location Area Code is a unique number of current location area. 
				A location area is a set of base stations that are grouped together to optimize signalling.
				
		- MCC	Mobile Country Code. This code identifies the country. 
				For example, in Switzerland MCC is equal to 228, in USA - 310, France - 208, Spain - 214.
				
		- MNC	Mobile Network Code. This code identifies the Network Operator
				For example, in Switzerland the MNC is equal to 01 for Swisscom, 02 for Sunrise and 03 for Salt.
	
	2.2 Database
	Concerning the Database, it is very simple and rely on a unique Table called CELLTOWERS 
	and structured as follows:
	
		CID				INT				
		LAC				INT
		MCC				INT
		MNC				INT
		NETWORK_TYPE	VARCHAR(10)
		PROVIDER_NAME	VARCHAR(25)
		
		LATITUDE		FLOAT
		LONGITUDE		FLOAT
		ALTITUDE		FLOAT
		ACCURACY		INT
		Address			VARCHAR(128)

	CID, LAC, MCC, MNC, NETWORK_TYPE AND PROVIDER_NAME are available from the device, 
	while Location information can be obtained form external sources (e.g unwiredlabs.com)
	
	2.3 Application
	
	Like most Software application, this mobile application consists in a User Interface (UI) 
	and some non-visible modules performing background tasks.
	In order to keep Object independent to each other and to improve re-usability, 
	most of the communication is performed through messaging.
	
		2.3.1 UI Description
		The UI consists in the following two Screens:
			- StartUpActivity:	The StartUpActivity is the initial Activity of the App.
								. Simply displays a splash screen. 
								. Responsible for the App. Initialization Sequence.
								. Launch MapActivty once initialization is done.
			- MapActivity:		The main Activity of the App.
								. It displays the information related to the current BTS.
								. It displays known BTS (already defined in Database) on 
								  a GoogleMap layer. 
		
		2.3.2 Modules (Code) Description
		The modules can be grouped in two categories:
			- UI-Code Modules (related to UI): This modules contain the code related to the UI Components.
								. FragCellTowerInfo : Code related to  the fragment frag_cell_tower_info
								. FragCelTowersMap : Code related to the fragment frag_celltowers_map
								. FragCellTowerInfoExt and FragCellTowersList are not used in the App.
								
			- Processing Code Modules : Performs background tasks such as BTS data retrieval and storage.
								. CellTower : Encapsulates the CellTower Data.
								. CellTowerDB : Along with CellTowerDBAdapter and DatabaseHelper, it takes 
												in charge Database Operations.
								. CellTowerInfoWindow : Manages the CellTower Info Window used by GoogleMap to
														display detailed information about the selected CellTower.
								. CellTowerLocation : Encapsulates the CellTower Location Data.
								. CellTowerLocationService : In Charge of the communication with the BTS Location service
															 supplied by unwiredlabs.com.
								. CellTowersAdapter : Adapter used to display the CellTower Data as a List.
													  It is currently unused.
								. CellTowersScanner : In charge of the detection of the current CellTower (that is, the one
													  the device is currently connected to). It supplies the currentCellTower 
													  data such as CId, Lac, MCC, etc ...
								. DialogInfoOK : Manage the DialogBox which is displayed when the device is detected 
												 as not connected to the GSM Network (e.g when in Flight Mode). 
												 A click on the OK button causes the App. to exit.
